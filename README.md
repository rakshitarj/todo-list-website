A simple and interactive To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project lets users add tasks, view them in a clean list, and delete tasks after completion.

##  Features

- Display tasks in a list
- Delete a task after completing it
- Clean and simple UI
- Fully responsive
- Beginner-friendly code

##  Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure of the webpage  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Adding interactivity (adding and removing tasks)

##  How to Run

   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
2. Keep them in the same folder.
3. Double-click **index.html** to open it in the browser.

##  How It Works (Simple Explanation)
- User enters a task in the input box.
